TRANSCRIPTION COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
<P> -- means that the last phrase has ended (i.e. a new phrase of text will begin now) -- one phrase is a transcription of someone talking without pause. In between these tags, each "line" sent is the newest update to the current phrase transcription

<INTEGER> -- the length of the phrase string within the payload that is sent

Example:
"Hi my name is Ari and I'm 23 years old. [PAUSE] Right now I'm working with Joey on figuring out how to set up a server listener thingy on Hololens."

<P><13>Hi my name is...

<18>Hi my name is Ari.

<39>Hi my name is Ari and I'm 23 years old.

<P><12>Right now...

Etc.
